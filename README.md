JMRI Framework
==============

*JMRI Framework* is an Objective-C library for developing [iOS](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action "iOS Developer Center @ Apple") applications that network with [JMRI](http://jmri.org) software.  Currently, this library only supports iOS and the JMRI [XMLIO](http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/web/XMLIO.shtml) protocol.

Installation & Use
------------------

*Forthcoming, once I recall my notes on how I use this*

Future Capabilities
-------------------

* Support for additional JMRI network protocols.
* Mac OS X support (This may *just work,* but I have not tested it).
